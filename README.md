# How to set GOPATH?

1> create your Go workspace directory

2> export GOPATH=$HOME/GoWork

3> run go env

This will reset on every new Terminal window or system restart. 

So, will set up this path in ~/.bashrc file

4> Add this path in .bashrc file.

export GOPATH=$HOME/GoWork

Now, you can..

1> install any package at $HOME/GoWork/pkg

2> write your code at $HOME/GoWork/src/

3> Find executable codes at $HOME/GoWork/bin

Happy Go coding.
